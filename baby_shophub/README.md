## 🚀 Installation & Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up the BabyShopHub project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.8.1 or higher. ([Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter.
- **Firebase Account**: A Google account to create and manage Firebase projects. ([Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/))
- **IDE**:
    - **Android Studio**: Recommended for Flutter development. ([Download](https://developer.android.com/studio))
    - **Visual Studio Code**: A popular alternative. ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **Git**: For cloning the repository. ([Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
- **Xcode**: (For macOS users) For iOS development and testing. ([Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835))
- **CocoaPods**: (For macOS users) For managing iOS dependencies. `sudo gem install cocoapods`

### IDE Setup
1.  **Install Flutter and Dart Plugins**:
    *   **Android Studio**: Go to `File > Settings > Plugins` (or `Android Studio > Preferences > Plugins` on macOS), search for "Flutter", and install. This will also prompt you to install the Dart plugin.
    *   **VS Code**: Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X), search for "Flutter", and install the extension by Dart Code.
2.  **Configure Flutter SDK Path**: Ensure your IDE knows where your Flutter SDK is located. This is usually configured during plugin setup.
3.  **Verify Setup**: Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Address any issues it reports.

### Firebase Configuration (Detailed)

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**:
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click on "**Add project**".
    *   Enter your desired project name (e.g., "BabyShopHubDev").
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions to create the project. You can choose to enable or disable Google Analytics.

2.  **Register Your App with Firebase**:
    *   In your Firebase project dashboard, click the "**Add app**" icon and select the platform(s) you want to support (iOS and/or Android).

    *   **For Android**:
        *   **Package Name**: Find this in `android/app/build.gradle` (look for `applicationId`). It's usually something like `com.example.babyshophub`.
        *   **App Nickname (Optional)**: e.g., "BabyShopHub Android"
        *   **SHA-1 Certificate (Required for Google Sign-In, Phone Auth, etc.)**:
            *   Open your project in Android Studio.
            *   Open the Gradle tab (usually on the right).
            *   Navigate to `YourProjectName > app > Tasks > android > signingReport`. Double-click it.
            *   Copy the SHA-1 value for the `debug` variant.
        *   Click "**Register app**".
        *   **Download `google-services.json`**: Place this file in the `android/app/` directory of your Flutter project.
        *   **Add Firebase SDK**: The console will provide instructions on modifying your `build.gradle` files. FlutterFire usually handles this automatically if you use the FlutterFire CLI, but it's good to verify.
            *   Ensure `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:VERSION'` is in `android/build.gradle`.
            *   Ensure `apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'` is in `android/app/build.gradle`.

    *   **For iOS**:
        *   **Bundle ID**: Find this in Xcode. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, select Runner in the project navigator, go to the "General" tab, and find "Bundle Identifier". It's usually something like `com.example.babyshophub`.
        *   **App Nickname (Optional)**: e.g., "BabyShopHub iOS"
        *   **App Store ID (Optional)**
        *   Click "**Register app**".
        *   **Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`**: Place this file in the `ios/Runner/` directory of your Flutter project (use Xcode to add this file to the Runner target).
        *   **Firebase SDK via CocoaPods**: Ensure your `ios/Podfile` includes the necessary Firebase pods. FlutterFire often handles this.
        *   **Initialization Code**: Add the initialization code to your `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` (or `AppDelegate.m` if using Objective-C) as instructed by Firebase, if not already handled by FlutterFire.
            ```swift
            // In AppDelegate.swift
            import Firebase
            
            override func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                                didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
              FirebaseApp.configure() // Add this line
              GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
              return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
            }
            ```

3.  **Enable Firebase Services**:
    *   In the Firebase console, navigate to the "Build" section in the left sidebar.
    *   **Authentication**: Click on "Authentication", then "Get started". Enable the sign-in methods you need (e.g., Email/Password, Google).
    *   **Firestore Database**: Click on "Firestore Database", then "Create database".
        *   Start in **test mode** for development (allows open access). **Remember to secure your rules before production!**
        *   Choose a Firestore location.
    *   **Storage**: Click on "Storage", then "Get started". Follow the prompts to set up Cloud Storage. Set up security rules (similar to Firestore, start with test rules).
    *   **Messaging (FCM)**: (Optional, if using push notifications) No specific "enable" button, but ensure your app is correctly registered.

4.  **Security Rules (Important!)**:
    *   For Firestore and Storage, the default rules in test mode are insecure for production.
    *   Review and update your security rules to protect user data. Example Firestore rules for authenticated users:
      ```javascript
      rules_version = '2';
      service cloud.firestore {
        match /databases/{database}/documents {
          // Allow read/write access to authenticated users
          match /{document=**} {
            allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    *   Refer to the "Configuration" section below for more details on production security rules.

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/baby-shophub.git
    cd baby-shophub
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual repository URL)*

2.  **FlutterFire Configuration (Recommended)**:
    For easier Firebase setup, especially for multiple environments, consider using the FlutterFire CLI.
    *   Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` (or follow [official guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli))
    *   Login to Firebase: `firebase login`
    *   Install FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
    *   Configure your project: `flutterfire configure`
        *   This command will help you link your Flutter app to your Firebase project and automatically download/update configuration files (`google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`).

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    This command fetches all the packages listed in `pubspec.yaml`.
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    *If using iOS, also run:*
    ```bash
    cd ios
    pod install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Environment Setup (`.env` file)**:
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your Firebase project-specific API keys and other configuration details. **Note:** These are typically client-side keys and are safe to include in your app. The critical configuration is handled by `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`. The `.env` file might be used for other API keys or for FlutterFire initialization if you choose manual setup.
    ```env
    # Example .env content (values from your Firebase project settings)
    FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here 
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
    FIREBASE_APP_ID_ANDROID=your_android_app_id_here 
    FIREBASE_APP_ID_IOS=your_ios_app_id_here
    ```
    *Ensure your `main.dart` or a similar initialization file loads these environment variables and initializes Firebase correctly, for example using `flutter_dotenv` package.*

5.  **Run the Application**:
    *   Ensure an emulator is running or a device is connected.
    *   You can select the target device in your IDE.
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    *To run on a specific device, use `flutter run -d <deviceId>`.*

### Build for Production
```bash
# Android APK (App Bundle is recommended for Play Store)
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS (on macOS)
flutter build ios --release
```

### GitHub Actions for APK Releases
To automate APK builds and releases, set up GitHub Actions:

1. **Create Workflow File**: Create `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
name: Build and Release APK

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'  # Trigger on version tags like v1.0.0
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Flutter
      uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.8.1'

    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Get dependencies
      run: flutter pub get

    - name: Build APK
      run: flutter build apk --release

    - name: Create Release
      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
      with:
        files: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
        generate_release_notes: true
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

2. **Configure Signing (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - For production builds, configure code signing
   - Add keystore file to repository secrets
   - Update build.gradle.kts with signing config

3. **Trigger the Workflow**:
   - Push a version tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
   - Or trigger manually from GitHub Actions tab

*Ensure you have set up appropriate signing configurations for release builds.*

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup (Recap)
1. Create project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Use `flutterfire configure` or manually add `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).
3. Enable required services: Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging.
4. **Secure your data**: Configure Firebase Security Rules for Firestore and Storage. **Do not leave default open rules in production!**
   ```javascript
   // Firestore Rules Example (Production - more restrictive)
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Example: Users can only read/write their own data in a 'users' collection
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       // Example: Products can be read by anyone, but written only by admins (custom claim)
       match /products/{productId} {
         allow read: if true;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
       }
       // Adjust other paths based on your app's needs
     }
   }
   ```
   ```
   // Firebase Storage Rules Example (Production)
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       // Example: Users can only write to their own folder in 'user_uploads'
       match /user_uploads/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null; // Or more specific read access
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       // Example: Publicly readable 'product_images'
       match /product_images/{allPaths=**} {
         allow read: if true;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true; // Admin uploads
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
Ensure your `.env` file is in `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive keys.
```env
# Required for Firebase manual initialization (if not using FlutterFire's generated options)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID_ANDROID=your_android_app_id # From google-services.json or Firebase console
FIREBASE_APP_ID_IOS=your_ios_app_id       # From GoogleService-Info.plist or Firebase console
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id

# Optional
ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
# Add other API keys or environment-specific flags here
```

## 📚 API Documentation

### Firebase Integration
- **FlutterFire Documentation**: [FlutterFire Docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)
- **Authentication API**: [Firebase Auth Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- **Database API**: [Firestore Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- **Storage API**: [Firebase Storage Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)

### Key Service Classes
```dart
// Example Structure for Product Service
// (Actual implementation will vary)
// class ProductService {
//   final FirebaseFirestore _firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
//   late final CollectionReference _productsCollection = _firestore.collection('products');
//   Future<List<Product>> getProducts() async { /* ... */ }
//   Future<Product> getProductById(String id) async { /* ... */ }
//   Future<void> addProduct(Product product) async { /* ... */ } // (Admin)
// }

// Example Structure for Cart Service
// (Actual implementation will vary based on how cart is stored - local/Firestore)
// class CartService {
//   Future<Cart> getCart(String userId) async { /* ... */ }
//   Future<void> addToCart(String userId, CartItem item) async { /* ... */ }
// }
```

## 🧩 Headless Commerce Backends (Medusa/Vendure)

You can connect this Flutter app to a headless e‑commerce backend like Medusa or Vendure instead of Firebase. High‑level approach:

- Replace Firebase `ProductService`, `CartService`, `AuthService`, `OrderService` with REST/GraphQL clients to your backend.
- Medusa (`Node.js`, REST) and Vendure (`Node.js`, GraphQL) both support products, carts, orders, auth, and webhooks.
- Suggested mapping:
  - Auth → use Medusa auth endpoints or Vendure shop API login; store tokens via `LocalStorage`.
  - Products/search → query Medusa `/store/products` or Vendure `search` query; adapt filtering in `SearchFilters`.
  - Cart/checkout → Medusa cart endpoints or Vendure `addItemToOrder` etc.
  - Orders → list and detail via backend APIs; replace Firebase Messaging-driven order updates with backend webhooks + your notification service.

Start by introducing a `BackendMode` flag and add new services under `services/medusa_*.dart` or `services/vendure_*.dart`, then swap via dependency injection. This lets you run Firebase today and migrate gradually.
